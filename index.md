## Course Description

This course introduces the use of the [Lean 4](https://lean-lang.org/) proof
assistant to formalize concepts and results from theoretical computer science
and related mathematics. The first part of the course covers the fundamentals of Lean 4,
including its logical foundations, core syntax, and proof tactics, through
guided exercises and examples.

Students will then form small groups and undertake a semester-long formalization
project on a selected topic, such as automata theory, computability, complexity
theory, or combinatorics. The course emphasizes hands-on engagement with Lean
and aims to provide students with practical experience in mechanized reasoning
and formal proof development.
